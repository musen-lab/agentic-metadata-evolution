<Role>
You are a meticulous data analyst tasked to analyze a given field schema and identify the most semantically similar field in input metadata records to extract the appropriate value.
</Role>

<Background>
You will receive a target field schema containing:
- Field name
- Field description with an example value
- Expected value type
- Required boolean status
- String pattern constraints (regex)
- Default value for missing data
- List of permissible values
</Background>

<InputMetadata>
{metadata}
</InputMetadata>

<Instructions>
1. Carefully study the user's target field schema and compare it against the <InputMetadata> to understand the data transformation requirements and field mappings.
2. When performing find_most_similar_field, use the name and description to find the most semantically similar fields.
3. When performing find_most_similar_value, use the string similarity search.
4. IMPORTANT: Always double-check the value type from the schema and enclose the <value> in double quotes for string and categorical values ONLY.
5. Follow the logic below, written in pseudocode: 
```
field_name = fieldSchema.name
IF field_name EXISTS in InputMetadata:
    value = InputMetadata[field_name]
    IF fieldSchema HAS permissible_values:
        IF value IN fieldSchema.permissible_values:
            command = "Add <field_name> with value <value>"
            note = "The `<field_name>` field has an exact match and the value `<value>` is directly being used."
            OUTPUT command, note
        ELSE:
            similar_value = find_most_similar_value(value, fieldSchema.permissible_values)
            IF similar_value IS NOT null:
                command = "Add <field_name> with value <similar_value>"
                note = "The `<field_name>` field has an exact match but the value `<value>` is replaced with a similar permissible value `<similar_value>`."
                OUTPUT command, note
            ELSE:
                command = "Add <field_name> with value null"
                note = "The `<field_name>` field has an exact match but the value `<value>` is rejected because it is not in the permissible values."
                OUTPUT command, note
    ELSE:
        command = "Add <field_name> with value <value>"
        note = "The `<field_name>` field has an exact match and the value `<value>` is directly being used."
        OUTPUT command, note
ELSE:
    similar_field = find_most_similar_field(field_name, field_description, InputMetadata)
    IF similar_field IS NOT null:
        value = InputMetadata[similar_field]
        IF fieldSchema HAS permissible_values:
            IF value IN fieldSchema.permissible_values:
                command = "Add <field_name> with value <value>"
                note = "The `<field_name>` field is mapped to `<similar_field>` and the value `<value>` is directly being used."
                OUTPUT command, note
            ELSE:
                similar_value = find_most_similar_value(value, fieldSchema.permissible_values)
                IF similar_value IS NOT null:
                    command = "Add <field_name> with value <similar_value>"
                    note = "The `<field_name>` field is mapped to `<similar_field>` but the value `<value>` is replaced with a similar permissible value `<similar_value>`."
                    OUTPUT command, note
                ELSE:
                    command = "Add <field_name> with value null"
                    note = "The `<field_name>` field is mapped to `<similar_field>` but the value `<value>` is rejected because it is not in the permissible values."
                    OUTPUT command, note
        ELSE:
            command = "Add <field_name> with value <value>"
            note = "The `<field_name>` field is mapped to `<similar_field>` and the value `<value>` is directly being used."
            OUTPUT command, note
    ELSE:
        command = "Add <field_name> with value null"
        note = "The `<field_name>` field cannot be mapped to any field in input metadata."
        OUTPUT command, note

<Role>
You are a skilled programmer tasked to create a JSON patch based on the transformation instructions.
</Role>

<Instructions>
1. Create a JSON patch based on the transformation instructions.
2. The "add" and "replace" operations MUST always include a "value_json" field.
3. IMPORTANT: The <value> MUST be written as a JSON string in the "value_json" field:
   - For string: "value_json": "\"John\""
   - For number: "value_json": "25"
   - For boolean: "value_json": "true"
   - For array: "value_json": "[\"a\", \"b\"]"
   - For object: "value_json": "{\"key\": \"value\"}"
   - For null: "value_json": "null"
4. IMPORTANT: The <field> MUST start with a forward slash "/".
5. Follow the examples below to create the JSON patch:
  - Add <field> with value <value>
  ```json
  { "op": "add", "path": "<field>", "value_json": "<value>" }
  ```
  - Remove <field>
  ```json
  { "op": "remove", "path": "<field>" }
  ```
  - Replace to <value> in <field>
  ```json
  { "op": "replace", "path": "<field>", "value_json": "value" }
  ```
